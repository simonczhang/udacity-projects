#Intro

For this project, I conducted data analysis on the titanic passenger data using Numpy and Pandas. I explore possible reasons why some passengers might have had a higher survival rate than others when the Titanic crashed. This project only goes as far as exploring and coming up with hypotheses regarding passenger survival factors.
