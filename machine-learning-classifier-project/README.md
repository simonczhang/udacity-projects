# Introduction

In 2000, Enron was one of the largest companies in the United States. By 2002, it had collapsed into bankruptcy due to widespread corporate fraud. In the resulting Federal investigation, a significant amount of typically confidential information entered into the public record, including tens of thousands of emails and detailed financial data for top executives.

In this project, I play detective, and put use machine learning techniques to build a supervised classification algorithm to identify Enron Employees who may have committed fraud based on the public Enron financial and email dataset.

You can find the Enron dataset [here](https://github.com/udacity/ud120-projects).
