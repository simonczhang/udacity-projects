### Summary
The story I created was based on the Baseball dataset provided by Udacity. I wanted to look at factors that could explain why some players hit so many more home runs than others despite similar batting averages. Many of these players are Hall of Famers. Could the physical factors included in the dataset explain anything?

### Design
I tried to make a simple and clean visualization because I chose to analyze the baseball dataset and wanted a wide audience of people to easily and quickly understand my visualizations and ideas. The visualizations I used were inherently straightforward (scatterplots, box plots, and bar charts).

Scatterplot was the best choice when looking at the relationship between HR and BA because it clearly shows a non-linear relationship between the two and also it was the plot that I based my whole story around. Next, I used a boxplot when pointing out the outliers in the data because boxplots visually separate out the outliers for you. It was also a natural choice since building boxplots in Tableau is done on top of a scatterplot which I was using first anyway. Finally, I needed to find a visualization that could best represent the two groups I was trying to compare and contrast. I don’t think there was a better choice for this than bar charts. I thought about using a pie chart for Handedness % comparison but I decided against it because there were 3 handedness and 2 groups which couldn’t easily be represented in 1 pie chart. Bar graph was still the best option.

I used color to enhance areas where I was comparing and contrasting two groups. I changed my colors around after getting feedback from my mother. I also minimized the smaller details of my graphics (titles, labels, font, size, etc) and other aesthetics after getting feedback from my mom.

### Feedback
Since my mom isn’t from America, she doesn’t really know anything about baseball. I thought she would be the perfect person to get feedback from; if I could make someone that doesn’t know anything about baseball understand my visualization, then I’ve succeeded. After I showed my story to my mother, she noticed redundancies and was confused on things like titles, labels, and details that I overlooked when I created my visualizations. Often times these small things made my visualization look messy and incoherent despite using simple graphics. My abbreviations like BA for Batting Average and HR for Home Runs were confusing she told me. She didn’t know what those meant at all. I also got rid of or edited some of the labels that Tableau automatically added to make the visualization more coherent and look cleaner.

I also started off using many different color palette, but after getting feedback from my mother, I realized these colors made some of my visualizations confusing and a lot of the time the colors didn’t do much to enhance her understanding of the visualization at all. I decided to stick with one color to represent the group I was focusing on to make it easy for the audience to understand my points of emphasis.



### Resources
I used only Tableau, Udacity lessons, and Tableau website documentation to complete this project.
